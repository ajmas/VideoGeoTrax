Video GeoTrax
=============

Initial author: Andre Mas

This project is used to demonstrate the display of a video of a journey, along with the corresponding route displayed on the same page, to give geographical
context.

The main challenge at this point is that the video and data track are acquired through separate applications, so some editing of the track needs to be done to ensure that it lines up with the video time. This could be resolved by having the video and geographical track generated through the same application.

At this point the project is just a demonstration, but if there is enough interest it could be developped into a more complete solution.
